# Explorative-Data-Analysis-EDA-
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a method or philosophy for data analysis that makes use of a range of (mostly graphical) strategies to maximise insight into a data set, reveal underlying structure, extract important aspects, find outliers and anomalies, test underlying hypotheses, create sparse models, and establish the best factor settings.

The Cardio Good Fitness dataset is used in the analysis, and EDA techniques are used to glean the pertinent information. This dataset includes details about customers who bought various treadmill models from a retailer.
